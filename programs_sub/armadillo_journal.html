									<span style="color:5d5d5d"><b>10:27AM Oklahoma time (8:27AM Washington time)</b> Typed by Apollo while on the plane</span><br/><br/>
									Hello, everyone! It’s Apollo the OSGC Armadillo! Wow! What an adventure so far!<br/><br/>
									Dorinda woke me up at 3:00AM this morning so that I would have plenty of time to get ready for our trip!  I had to take a 
									shower and really shine up my shell for the trip (no hair dryer needed)! I finished packing my shell with all of the necessary 
									items (shell wash, shell polish, my favorite book, etc.).  Then, I enjoyed some breakfast just in case I couldn’t find anything 
									good to eat at the airport!<br/><br/>
									
									By 4:00AM we were ready to go and drove from Hydro, Oklahoma to the Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Do you know 
									how far it is from Hydro, Oklahoma to the airport in Oklahoma City? I wonder how you could figure that out? Do you think Mapquest 
									could help you find the answer? Once you know how far it is, <b>can you calculate how long our trip was if Dorinda drove mostly at 70 miles 
									per hour?</b><br/><br/>
									
									We made it in plenty of time to the airport! Boy, was I relieved! I didn't want to miss my very first plane trip, not to mention my very 
									first trip to Seattle, WA. Dorinda parked the mini-van and then we quickly scurried into the airport! Well, I scurried- I had packed 
									lightly. Dorinda, however, has a really hard time packing lightly and sort of looks like she is trying to wheel an elephant through the 
									airport (I wonder if she will notice that I was really helpful last night and took out some of her shoes while she slept to help make the 
									bags lighter)! Oh, well, at least she will have everything (and the kitchen sink) that she could possibly need(minus the shoes I relocated 
									back into her closet)!<br/><br/>
									
									Once inside the airport, we checked in at the United Airlines counter. They had to look at our ID's (it's a good thing I packed mine in my 
									shell last night) to make sure the names on our tickets matched the names on our identification. Then, they weighed our bags! Since my shell 
									counts as one "carry-on" item, I didn’t have to check any bags. Dorinda loaded her "elephant" (a.k.a- her suitcase) onto the scale and 
									surprisingly it weighed 9.5 pounds under the maximum weight for United Airlines. How much is the maximum weight for checked baggage on United 
									Airlines flights? How could you find this information? <b>Once you have found out the maximum weight for the baggage, figure out how much 
									Dorinda’s bag weighed.</b><br/><br/>
									
									After the counter, we met up with the Administrative Coordinator for the Oklahoma NASA Space Grant Consortium, Kelly Goodrich, and headed for security. 
									At security, I emptied out my shell into a small rectangular gray box so the security officers could send it through a machine with a conveyor belt 
									to x-ray everything that was inside of it.  While they x-rayed the contents of my shell, I headed over to a circular machine in which I lifted my 
									cute little armadillo arms while it scanned my body.  This whole process is very important to ensure the safety of all of the travelers at the 
									airport! After they scanned me and all of the items I brought in my shell, we were ready to head to our gate.<br/><br/>
									
									After meeting up with Thelma Wallace, we waited at our gate for them to call our flight at 6:15AM to Denver, Colorado. Since we can’t travel straight 
									to Seattle from Oklahoma City, we had a layover in Denver on our way to Seattle. Once they called our boarding group, I boarded the plane 
									with all 3 ladies!<br/><br/>
									
									We landed just before 7:00AM in Denver, Colorado. <b>Do you know what time that would be in Oklahoma?</b> We waited for our final flight to Seattle, which 
									took off a little after 8:00AM. <b>About what time was it in Oklahoma when we left the Denver airport?</b><br/><br/>
									
									Now, I have finally caught you up to what I am currently doing! I am riding in an airplane!<br/><br/> 
									
									There are so many things you can do while you fly on the plane. I really like looking out the airplane windows at the Earth below. They have headsets 
									and screens so that you can watch shows while you travel. I am too excited to do so, but some people are even sleeping the whole way there! One of my 
									favorite parts is having time to read my favorite book, <i>The Armadillo from Amarillo</i> by Lynne Cherry.<br/><br/>
									
									When I get off the plane, I am going to try and get a picture with the pilot! Well, that’s all for right now! I will check back in later today after I 
									have had a chance to check-in and explore some of Seattle!<br/><br/>
									
									Your Adventurous Friend,<br/>
									Apollo the OSGC Armadillo<br/><br/>
									
									<i>Teachers and Parents, please encourage your students/children to find the answers to Apollo’s questions in this entry. Great resources for answering 
									the questions are the websites for Mapquest(car travel question) and United Airlines (luggage question). If you want to make the car travel question 
									a little more difficult to find the answer, don’t let them use Mapquest. Instead, give them a map of the United States of America with a scale. Using a 
									ruler, map knowledge, and mathematical skills, they will be able to find the answer!</i>

									Howdy from Seattle, Washington! Sorry I didn’t post in the journal earlier, but I have been so busy seeing all the sights here in Seattle!<br/><br/>

									After we landed and checked into our hotel, we started walking around the city to see everything we could see! We saw a Target, that didn’t look like 
									a target at all. It was three stories tall and and didn’t even say Target on the building (see the picture below). We were able to see the ocean, 
									and boy was it beautiful! My favorite place, though, was Pike’s Place Market. I ate the freshest pears I have ever tasted and saw fish flying 
									through the air!<br/><br/>
									
									After we returned to the hotel, we changed for our dinner at Sky City, which is at the top of the Seattle Space Needle. We rode an elevator all the way 
									to the restaurant. As we ate, the restaurant rotated so we could see ALL of Seattle. After dinner, we rode all the way to the observation deck and took 
									even more pictures. I am always amazed with how a city looks from a distance! I love an aerial view of a city!<br/><br/>
									
									Just a little while ago, we hopped on the monorail and traveled back to the hotel for bedtime! I can’t wait to tell you about my adventures tomorrow! 
									Good night!<br/><br/>
									
									<i>Teachers/ Parents: Have your students/ children look up information about Seattle on websites. Also, look up the space needle website and the Sky City 
									website so that they can get a better idea of what Apollo experienced last night!</i>
