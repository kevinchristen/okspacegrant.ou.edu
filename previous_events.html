									"This past summer I had the privilege of interning at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. I worked for the Advanced 
									Materials & Processing Branch under Dr. Frank Palmieri and Dr. John Connell. My project was focused on laser surface preparation techniques 
									for adhesively bonded aerospace materials. The goal for the project was to try to find more economical, greener, and durable bonds using laser 
									ablation surface engineering. I had an amazing experience working alongside some of the nation's experts in aerospace materials, conducting 
									laboratory experiments, analyzing data, and presenting our results. While there, my mentor also sponsored for me to attend the National Council 
									of La Raza Latino Advocacy Conference in Washington, DC where I helped promote NASA at their family expo booth."

									"This summer I worked on developing a mobile presence for the NTRS.  The NTRS (NASA Technical Reports Server) is a database that contains all of 
									the publicly available records that NASA has published.  I started out with creating a mobile application, but then eventually changed focus 
									towards a mobile website instead.  The reason why a mobile website was chosen instead of an application is that creating a mobile website would 
									be able to work on multiple platforms such as: Android, Blackberry, and IPhone.  Whereas developing for a mobile application would have required 
									multiple applications to be built for all platforms to be able to access the information. I completed the mobile websites functionality, but was 
									not able to get the search portion of the website up and running because access could not be granted to the production servers in the time that 
									I was there. I feel that this summer was a huge benefit to my technical skill set, as well as getting a taste of what it is like to work in a 
									professional environment.  After working at NASA this summer I feel that I am more prepared, whenever I graduate, to step into a full-time job."

									"This summer, my time was spent working at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, MD on NASA's digital beamforming synthetic 
									aperture radar (DBSAR).  Leveraging off of my graduate studies of digital transceivers, I was able directly apply my thesis work to the 
									DBSAR system.  This included waveform generation techniques (simulated and implemented), digital intermediate frequency (IF) receiver theory, 
									and radar controlling software applications.  My primary job was to develop, debug, troubleshoot, and maintain the platform's firmware and 
									software systems.  Additionally, my internship included preparing the radar to be flight ready for a campaign in August and printed circuit 
									board (PCB) design for upgraded hardware modules to the DBSAR.  Aside from working, I was fortunate enough to be able to drive down to Cape 
									Canaveral, FL to witness STS-135, NASA's final space shuttle mission."

									This summer I was able to get my hands on many different projects, even the opportunity to work side by side with the NASA-Goddard CIO. My main 
									project was assisting the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Team with building a process of incorporating emerging technologies such as artificial 
									intelligence and holographic interfaces into their Center (primarily focused on conference room technologies). Employees there felt this new 
									technology will help them to become more flexible and collaborative in conferencing. They wanted to be able to interact not only with people 
									attending the meetings, but also people using VoIP systems, teleconferencing, or conferencing remotely using high tech video cameras to look in.<br/>
									Secondly, I worked with the Web Enterprise Service Techologies (WEST) contracted.  They are a company that contracts through NASA and are 
									responsible for everything that deals with web application and services.<br/>
									With this group I worked with the IT-Security people. I analyzed databases and helped provide technical reports for the database. Also, I learned 
									PERL Scripting language, and wrote a script on HTTP Request/Response Headers for the security of external NASA domains for public users.<br/>
									Finally, I received the opportunity along with 5 other interns to work along side the Chief Information Officer (CIO). We helped put together 
									technical videos and presentations for his presentation to the other divisions within the Center. Currently, each code manages their own IT 
									infrastructure and the CIO wanted to provide one centralized IT infrastructure that will ultimately save NASA money.I had an awesome time at Goddard, 
									and would highly recommend this opportunity to anyone! I learned that if you work hard, good things will come. After leaving, I got a call from 
									the Kennedy Space Center to work on computer hardware systems. Also, I learned the key to networking 
									and meeting others and exchanging information. I have gained tons and friends, and I still remain in contact today. And finally, I learned that your 
									school does not define you. I attend SWOSU which isn't that big of a school, but with hard work I was given an opportunity and made the most of it.

									Langley/Goddard Trip <a name="langley"></a>
								</div>
								<div class="normal">
									<span style="color:#5d5d5d">Rob Johnson, April 10</span> - Every year Oklahoma NASA Space Grant Consortium takes selected 
									students and faculty members on a NASA Workforce Development experience. The student's educational backgrounds come mainly 
									from STEM fields but also include areas in aviation and business-related majors. The purpose of the workforce development 
									trip is to give students a firsthand look at the various careers that NASA can offer. The students get a chance to visit 
									with research scientists as well as NASA administration. In addition to interaction with NASA employees, the students 
									receive a behind the scenes tour of the facilities and, in some cases, are allowed to see scientists work on active 
									projects/missions.
									<div class="indented">
										This year's trip took place during the week of spring break. Through a highly competitive application process, ten students 
										were selected from across the state to join faculty members and the OSGC office on a visit of two NASA research facilities. 
										These facilities were the Langley Research Center in Langley, VA and the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. 
									</div>
									<div class="indented">
										At the Langley Research Center, the students were able to experience the diversity of NASA's model workshops. Here, workers and 
										researchers develop and build scale models of a variety of aircrafts and aviation parts. With these cost-effective models, 
										scientists and manufacturers can devise future aircrafts and improve current designs. The students also got to explore the 
										National Transonic Facility (NTF), where NASA is able to tests these models. The NTF at Langley is a high pressure, cryogenic, 
										closed-circuit wind tunnel where not only NASA, but several aviation companies test aircraft designs.
									</div>
									<div class="indented">
										At the Goddard Space Flight center, the students were greeted by the Chief Information Officer, Dr. Ed Rogers, who gave a 
										presentation on how the administration and scientists work together on mission planning and the importance of teamwork and 
										communication. Students then were taken on a tour, behind the safety of observation areas, of the world's largest clean room. 
										Here students were able to see scientists actively working on NASA's new space telescope, the James Webb Telescope. At the 
										end of the visit, students were able to visit the workshop of the next generation of robotic rovers. This shop is designed 
										to have high school and college interns work alongside researchers to develop and build robots that can function in extreme 
										environments. 
									</div>
									<div class="indented">
										Since the trip took place near Washington, DC, students were given the opportunity to visit the Smithsonian's Air and Space 
										Museum. Through an assortment of aircrafts and rockets, students were able to see the history of flight and the beginnings of 
										NASA.
